title: Open For Business
---

Shortly after the Easter break, I slowly began inviting early adopters to try
out NewBusinessMonitor. The feedback so far has been positive, and a couple of
people gave especially thorough reviews with annotated screenshots. Thank you so
much for that!

Most features are already implemented and are working well. The next two larger
chunks of work on my roadmap are:

1. Regular email reports
2. Opening the service to everyone

I'll publish these changes and some other minor fixes as time allows, and I'll
be posting here once various pieces are done.

Problems or questions? [Write to me][email].
